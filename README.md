# Document Scanner

## Document Scanner with OpenCV and Python

I used this Project to run this in real time and save these images by pressing just "S" button on the keyboard.

The scanner takes a poorly scanned image, finds the corners of the document, applies the perspective transformation to get a top-down view of the document, sharpens the image, and applies an adaptive color threshold to clean up the image.
